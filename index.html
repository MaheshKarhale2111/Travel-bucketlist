                    <h3> Kerala </h3>


                    <p>
                        Known as ‘God’s Own Country’, picturesque Kerala is a must on any travel bucket list. The more
                        laidback pace of life is the perfect introduction to India and is a stark contrast to bustling
                        destinations such as the Golden Triangle. This wonderful state right at the bottom of India has
                        so much to offer, from tantalising cuisine, wonderful wildlife, mesmerising culture and lots to
                        explore.

                        Getting to Kerala is surprisingly straightforward, with direct flights from London and flights
                        with one in-airport transfer from many major UK cities. If you’re wondering when to visit,
                        December and January can be very busy, and the monsoon season from June until the end of August
                        is best avoided. From the end of September is our favourite time, when the greenery comes to
                        life after the heavy rain.
